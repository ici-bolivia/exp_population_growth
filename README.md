Exponential population growth model demonstrating effects of deterministic and stochastic population dynamics

This is the complementary model documentation to our publication:  
Herzog et al. 2018, "Deterministic population growth models and conservation translocation as a management strategy for the critically endangered Blue-throated Macaw (Ara glaucogularis): A critique of Maestri et al."

## Overview
An exponential populataion growth model was used by Maestri et al. (2017) to propose reinforcement policies for the critically endangered Blue-Throated Macaw. We show that the interpretation and proposal of conservation strategies such as reinforcement depends heavily on the available data and the choice of modelling approach. We compare determinisitic and stochastic modelling of population growth and conclude that deterministic models are likely to lead to overly optimistic and simplified conservation strategies.  

For further details on the background of this work we refer to the corresponding publications.
